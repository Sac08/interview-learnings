🎤 Mock Question #1

## "Tell me about a time you had to work under a tight deadline. How did you handle it, and what was the outcome?"

Situation:
“Last year, just before my marriage, I was responsible for delivering a new service that was critical to an upcoming product launch. The timeline was tight, and I also had a fixed hard stop because of my planned leave.”

Task:
“My responsibility was to ensure the service was fully implemented, tested, and maintainable before I left, so the team wouldn’t be blocked in my absence.”

Action:
“To manage this, I reprioritized my schedule. I aligned with my manager in 1:1s to cut down on low-value activities, such as long standups — I would contribute my updates and return to focus on development.
I also collaborated with a junior engineer, assigning them ownership of writing test cases. This not only accelerated testing but ensured knowledge transfer, so someone else could step in if issues arose during my leave. Additionally, I documented the setup and key workflows for smooth maintainability.”

Result:
“As a result, we delivered the service on time, two days before my leave. The launch went smoothly, and while I was away, the junior was able to handle minor issues without escalations. The manager appreciated both the delivery and the proactive handover, which reinforced trust in my ability to deliver under pressure while ensuring long-term maintainability.”

## "Tell me about a time when you faced a challenging situation with tight deadlines and unexpected issues. How did you handle it?"

Situation:
“During a new service development project, I was assigned a feature implementation that was running in parallel with another ongoing feature. As we approached the testing phase, I started noticing multiple bugs in my feature — around 4–5 per day — which was concerning given the tight timeline. At the same time, I had a personal constraint: I had a scheduled surgery coming up, so my availability after a certain date was limited.”

Task:
“My task was to ensure that my feature was delivered on time, with high quality, without blocking the parallel feature development or creating friction with my teammate.”

Action:
“To handle this, I first carefully tracked and documented all bugs and their impact on functionality. I then discussed the situation with my manager, presenting clear data on the bugs and potential risks. I suggested a collaborative approach with the teammate working on the parallel feature to prioritize fixes and perform cross-testing where needed. Additionally, I coordinated with a junior engineer to take over some test cases and minor bug fixes so the work could continue smoothly during my absence.”

Result:
“As a result, the feature was delivered on time, with the critical bugs resolved before my surgery. My manager appreciated the proactive escalation and documentation, and the teammate felt supported rather than blamed. This approach minimized risk, maintained quality, and ensured smooth handover while keeping the team morale intact.”
