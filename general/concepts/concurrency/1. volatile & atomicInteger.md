volatile keyword - needed to avoid visibility problem.
(The "visibility problem" in Java primarily arises in multithreaded environments and refers to the issue where changes made to shared variables by one thread may not be immediately visible to other threads.)
This happens because each thread have stored eg boolean values in their local cache & not in shared cache
when volatile keyword is used jvm flushes that value from local to shared cache

AtomicInteger's are for counters (increment normally has 3 ops i.e read, incr, update) this class provides atomic incr
