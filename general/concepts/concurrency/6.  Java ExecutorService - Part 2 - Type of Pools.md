1. FixedThreadPool

A pool with a fixed number of threads.

Excess tasks wait in a queue until a thread is free.

Use case: Stable workload, limit resource usage.

2. CachedThreadPool

Creates new threads as needed, but reuses idle threads.

Can grow unbounded.

Use case: Many short-lived async tasks.

3. SingleThreadExecutor

Only one worker thread.

Executes tasks sequentially in order.

Use case: Tasks that must not run in parallel (logging, file I/O).

4. ScheduledThreadPool

Executes tasks after a delay or periodically.

Like a cron job scheduler.

Use case: Heartbeat tasks, scheduled cleanups.
